Fruit Freshness Detection using CNN (Google Colab)

A Deep Learning project built in Google Colab that classifies fruit images into Fresh or Rotten using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The model is trained using ImageDataGenerator, TensorFlow/Keras, and a Kaggle dataset.

* Project Overview

This project uses a custom CNN model to analyze fruit images and predict whether the fruit is Fresh or Rotten.

* What this project demonstrates:

Deep Learning model training in Google Colab

CNN-based image classification

Using Kaggle API to download datasets

Image preprocessing & augmentation

Accuracy and loss visualization

Predicting freshness from a single uploaded image

*Dataset

You can use any Kaggle dataset:
